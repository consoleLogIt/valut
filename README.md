limitations :
1. i can implement a better authentication logic but currently storing the token directly in the localstorage which is not secure.
2. can implement a better input validation before sending it to the server.
3. i can implement a checksum checking to verify the data integrity that is coming from the sever.
4. Readability can be improved. but i have not done it.
5. ux can be improved..
